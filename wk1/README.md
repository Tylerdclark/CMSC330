# Creating Parse Trees

**To verify that a string of characters belongs to a language defined by a grammar, we must create a parse tree that shows that the string can be generated by the grammar.**

**Consider the following grammar:**

``` html
<list> -> <item> , <list> | <item>
<item> -> <left> <item> <right> | <left> <right>
<left> -> A| B | C 
<right> -> x | y | z
```

**Choose a string that is in this language and create a parse tree that demonstrates that your claim is true. Identify another string that contains some of these terminals symbols but is not in the language.**

## My response

Based on the grammar, ABCzxy, BCzy, Cz could be a potential string with the following parse tree:

I think there could be infinite permutations of strings not in the language. But as an example, the following string uses terminal symbols from the language but does not adhere to the grammar:

**AAA, BB, C**

The reason this could not be from this language is because each <item> requires a ```<right>``` to be present in addition to the ```<left>```.

For the above parse tree, I used the website: http://mshang.ca/syntree/ with the following code:

``` html
[<list>
    [<item>
        [<left> A]
        [<item>
            [<left> B]
            [<item>
                [<left> C]
                [<right> z]
            ]
            [<right> y]
        ]
        [<right> x]
    ]
    ,
    [<list>
        [<item>
            [<left> B]
            [<item>
                [<left> C]
                [<right> z]
            ]
            [<right> y]
        ]
        ,
        [<list>
            [<item>
                [<left> C]
                [<right> z]
            ]
        ]
    ]
]
```
